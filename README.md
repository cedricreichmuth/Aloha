Project 01: Aloha Apparel co.
A webpage for a clothing company
Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery libraries including slick carousel plugin
Personal learnings: Think smaller; the mistake that prevents everything from working is mostly tiny, not something global.
To view page, add "/html/index.html" to the url.
